		<p class="content">I love finding new ways to deliver content and develop a unique user experience. I have a strong background in Javascript and experience developing applications that allow users to connect and have a shared experience in a product. I've worked on the full stack of multiplayer virtual reality gaming, video streaming, mobile social media, dynamic data visualization, and more. I love solving puzzles and puzzling algorithms, and outside of the "programming job" I enjoy exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual reality, video and music sharing, and game development. </p>
